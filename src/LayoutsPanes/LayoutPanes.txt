JavaFX provides a variety of layout panes—specialized containers that help you arrange and manage UI elements in
your application.

Each layout pane offers a different strategy for positioning and sizing its child nodes.

Here’s an overview of the most common types and their definitions:

1. Pane
Definition:
The simplest container, which does no automatic layout of its children.

Usage:
Use when you need absolute positioning of elements. You have to manually set the position of each child node.

2. FlowPane
Definition:
Arranges its children in a flow that wraps at the container's boundary.

Usage:
Ideal for creating layouts where elements are laid out sequentially and should wrap to the next line when space is limited.

3. HBox and VBox
HBox (Horizontal Box):

Definition: Arranges nodes in a single horizontal row.

Usage: Great for side-by-side controls like buttons, labels, or other UI components.

VBox (Vertical Box):

Definition: Arranges nodes in a single vertical column.

Usage: Useful for stacking elements vertically, such as form fields or menus.

4. BorderPane
Definition:
Divides the scene into five regions: top, bottom, left, right, and center.

Usage:
Ideal for applications with a standard layout (e.g., header, footer, sidebar, and central content).
Each region can hold a node, and the center region typically expands to fill available space.

5. GridPane
Definition:
Lays out its children within a flexible grid of rows and columns.

Usage:
Perfect for forms or any layout where you want precise control over rows and columns.
You can specify column/row spans for more complex arrangements.

6. StackPane
Definition:
Places its children on top of each other in a stack, with the first added node at the bottom.

Usage:
Useful for overlaying elements (e.g., putting text on an image) or creating scenes where elements share the same space.

7. AnchorPane
Definition:
Allows you to anchor child nodes to one or more of its edges.

Usage:
Ideal when you want to maintain a fixed distance between a node and the pane’s borders, even as the window is resized.

8. TilePane
Definition:
Arranges nodes in uniformly sized tiles, either horizontally or vertically.

Usage:
Often used for galleries or dashboards where items need to be displayed in a grid-like format with equal spacing.

Each layout pane is designed with specific use cases in mind. By choosing the appropriate layout pane—or even
combining them—you can create sophisticated and responsive UIs that adapt well to different screen sizes and user
interactions.
